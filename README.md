This project helps music producers and composers to create chord progressions based on their knowledge of music theory. 

The composers will describe what kind of chord progression they want. For example: "I want a chord progression that makes me feel near the beach while I'm drinking pinas coladas".

The output of this will be a MIDI file with the chord progression ready to start to work with a DAW like ProTools, GarageBand, and Cubase among others.
